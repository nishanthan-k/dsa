## Approach
1. Same as we do for extracting the digits
2. Initialize an temp variable with 0
3. Run the loop untill n becomes 0
4. On each iteration,
      a.) Calculate the last digit by n%10
      b.) Multiply the temp by 10 and add last digit to it

```Python
n = 1234
rev = 0

while n > 0:
  last = n%10
  rev = (rev * 10) + last
  
  n //= 10
  
print(True if n == rev else False)
```
