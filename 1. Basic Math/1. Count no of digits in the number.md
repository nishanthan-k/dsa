## Brute force
1. Run the while loop untill the number becomes 0
2. On each interation remove the 0's place of the number by n/10 and increment the counter
3. Finally return the counter

  ```Python
  n = 10
count = 0
while n > 0:
  n //= 10
  count += 1

print(count)
 ``` 

## Optimal
1. We can use log10, because log10(positive number) returns the count (in float)
2. So we have to use floor / convert it to int directly and have to increment it by 1 to match the length

```Python
import math

print(int(math.log10(n) + 1))
```
