## Approach 1
1. Run a loop from 1 to n
2. Add the i to the divisors if n%i == 0

```Python
def print_divisors(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
    return divisors
```

## Approach 2
1. There is a mathematical observation, if k is a divisor of n
2. Which means k * x = n like 2 * 18 = 36
3. Also 18 * 2 = 36 right
4.  1 * 36, 2 * 18, 3 * 12, 4 * 9, 6 * 6
5.  9 * 4, 12 * 3, 18 * 2, 36 * 1
6.  It is like x * y then y * x, but how can we know y if we have x. Formaula -> x * y = n, y = n / x
7.  This pattern will repeat again after one common point where i > sqrt(n)
8.  So to avoid redudant iterations, we just need to run the loop from 1 to sqrt(n) + 1 (inclusive)
9.  On each iteration check for n%i == 0 and also check for i != n/i (x != n/x, 6 * 6 = 36 so to avoid multiple entry of 6 check if x & y are not equal)

```Python
import math

def print_divisors(n):
    divisors = []
    sqrt = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(1, sqrt):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
              divisors.append(n // i)
    return divisors
    
print(print_divisors(36))
```
