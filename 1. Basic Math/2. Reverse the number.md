## Approach
1. To reverse the number we have to read from last to first
2. But on int we can't run the reverse loop like we do on strings
3. But we can get the last digit, remainder of the 'n' when divides by the 10
4. Divide by 10 for one's place, 100 for 10th place, 1000 for 100th place and so on...

```Python
n = 1234
rev = 0

while n > 0:
  last = n%10
  rev = (rev * 10) + last
  
  n //= 10
  
print(rev)
```
