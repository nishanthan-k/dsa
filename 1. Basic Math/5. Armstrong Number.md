## Approach 1
1. Get the digits count either by traditional way (increment the counter untill 'n' becomes 0) or use any in-built method
2. Use the traditional way and add the 0th place digit in the 'n' multipled by the digit's length

```Python
class Solution:
    def armstrongNumber (self, n):
        k = len(str(n))
        sum = 0
        temp = n
        
        while n > 0:
            r = n % 10
            sum += r**k
            n //= 10
        
        return sum == temp
```
