## Approach 1
1. Repeatedly subtract the smaller number from the larger number until one of them becomes 0.
2. Once one of them becomes 0, the other number is the GCD of the original numbers.

```Python
class Solution:
    def getGCD(self, n1, n2):
        while n1 > 0 and n2 > 0:
            return self.getGCD(abs(n1 - n2), min(n1, n2))
        
        if n1 == 0:
            return n2
        else:
            return n1

    def findGCD(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n1, n2 = max(nums), min(nums)
        return self.getGCD(n1, n2)
        
```

## Approach 2
1. As we are repeatedly subtracting, using modulo(%) will help us to reduce the iteration steps

   ```Python
   class Solution:
    def getGCD(self, n1, n2):
        while n1:
            n1, n2 = n2 % n1, n1
        return n2

    def findGCD(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n1, n2 = max(nums), min(nums)
        return self.getGCD(n1, n2)
        
   ```
